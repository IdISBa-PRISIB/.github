# Health Data Research Platform of the Balearic Islands (PRISIB)

Welcome to the GitHub space of the Health Data Research Platform of the Balearic Islands (PRISIB), a platform within the Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa). 

We created this space to foster collaboration with other institutions and to share some of the work we're doing.

- [EMA RWD Catalogue](https://catalogues.ema.europa.eu/node/1052/administrative-details)

### Ongoing Initiatives
We're proud to be part of several exciting projects, including:
- [EHDEN](https://ehden.eu/)
- [OHDSI Spain Node](https://www.ohdsi-europe.org/index.php/national-nodes/spain)
- [IMPaCT-Data](https://impact-data.bsc.es/)

### Collaboration with IdISBa Platforms
Our team also works closely with other research platforms within IdISBa, including:
- [Biobank](https://www.idisba.es/en/Support-Services/Scientific-Technical-Platforms/Biobank)
- [Experimental Surgery and Animal Facility](https://www.idisba.es/en/Support-Services/Scientific-Technical-Platforms/Experimental-Surgery-and-Animal-Facility)
- [Clinical Trials Unit](https://www.idisba.es/en/Support-Services/Scientific-Technical-Platforms/Clinical-Research-and-Clinical-Trials-Unit-UICEC-)

### What’s Next?
We’re developing a data catalogue that will soon be available to the public. Researchers interested in Real World Data (RWD) will be able to assess the feasibility of their projects using our data. However, if you don’t find what you need, don’t worry—we’re committed to breaking down data silos for research. Feel free to contact us at [idisba.prisib@ssib.es](mailto:idisba.prisib@ssib.es), and we’ll work to help you out.
